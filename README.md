# Heart Failure Prediction and Interpretability

This project uses the [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) from Kaggle to explore predictive modeling and interpretability techniques.

The focus is on understanding the dataset and applying methods to enhance interpretability, such as Logistic Lasso Regression, SHAP, and Neural Additive Models.
